The goal of this problem set was to create a linear programming model in R that minimized the busing cost per student across 6 areas and 3 schools, while holding to the appropriate grade percentage thresholds for each school and not violating the school capacities. After building the model and determining the initial optimal solution, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of road construction on busing costs and how that would change the ideal distribution of students across schools. Finally, in order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of installing a portable classroom to increase a school's capacity, we investigated the school constraint duals (shadow prices) and their respective dual ranges in order to find the largest cost minimization margin over the classroom leasing cost.
